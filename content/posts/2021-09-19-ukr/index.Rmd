## Ukraine Nightlights






```{r cars, message=F, echo=F}
# Import Nightlights
pthuk <- "/Users/parthkhare/Desktop/CGD/Projects/Ukraine FB Mobility NTL/nightlights/Ukraine mosaics/2022"
alras <- list.files(pthuk, pattern = ".*tif", full.names = T)

Jan <- raster(alras[3])

plot(Jan)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
