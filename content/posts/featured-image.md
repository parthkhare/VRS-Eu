## Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) - Annually 1992-2012

US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) was launched in 1992. As suggested by the name its intented purpose was to detect surface objects (moving tanks, ships) 
from the sky, with an arguable application during Desert Fox.
Later it was released for public access by NOAA, and has since then being used as a proxy for economic activity, particularly for regions with poor stastistical capacity.
Despite its unique ability to discern spatial 



## Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) - Monthly/Annually 2012 (April) - 

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on-board the SUOMI-NPP satellite, replaced the US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS)-based data since 2012. The VIIRS is available from the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at a monthly frequency starting from April 2012. In addition, NOAA provides two annual images (2015 and 2016) which removes several artifacts from the raw series. But these remain in the monthly images that we use in our analysis. This is the primary rationale behind the refinements to the raw series.
