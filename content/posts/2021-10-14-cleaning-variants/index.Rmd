## VIIRS Sensor issues

From 2012, the newer generation of nightlights observations, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), that replaced DMSP-OLS overcame the limitations discussed above.
However, the ultra-low light detection capability of VIIRS DNB also comes with a drawback. It is contaminated by several light sources not directly related to human activities. These sources include stray lights, moon light, lightning, background “noise”, atmospheric backscatter, and others (Elvidge et. al. 2017; Román et al. 2018).

Broad challenges (from remote sensing literature) are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /> 
<br /> 
 
- Ephemeral events: crop-residue burning, forest fires, or gas flaring, presence of these anomalies, emitted lights may get scattered and the sensor can record a significant spike in the intensity of lights, that can in turn lead to abnormal variations in the aggregated data

<br /> 

- Cloud cover: The presence of clouds can limit the number of clear NTL observations and therefore bias the recorded light intensities.Figure shows how the percentage of cloud-free observations (out of the total number of observations from April 2012 to January 2020) varies across time and geography. Darker the orange shade, more is the cloud cover. Darker blue shade indicates least cloud cover.

<br /> 
  
- Biophysical seasonality: These include changes in tree and snow cover. Phenological changes are seasonal changes in vegetation and photosynthetic leaf area at the pixel level. Figure demonstrates the impact of a phenological change on the time series of recorded NTL for a pixel located in central Delhi. The smaller image at the inset shows that the pixel has a significant tree cover, which can lead to seasonal patterns in NTL as detected by the sensor.

### Instance from India
Raw sum of lights, across many states in India, occasionally drop before reverting within a year, without any clear underlying socio-economic phenomenon driving these movements. These are not adequately explained by the disruptions caused by natural calamities either

## Cleaning: What we did

Regression results from different ways NTL data was prepared
![](/cleaning-variant/results-cleaning.png)

- Addressing negative values: addressing negative months across districts
  - V1: Replacing negative values for months with 0 at district level and subsequently aggregating to country level 
  - V2: Replacing negative values for months with positive value from preceding months at district level and subsequently aggregating to country level 
  - V3: Removing negative months from data and subsequently aggregating to country level 
  - V4:Removing 5 countries ('ERI','GUY','PNG','NAM','SLB’) with highest negative pixels by area


- Addressing seasonality by selecting district-months with least noise:  There were multiple negative pixels in the data, causing sum of pixel for districts(admin2) to be negative for certain months. Use GDP data to train and identify months with poor signal and either eliminate or re-weight them (Elastic-net/Lasso)
  - Using sum_pix (and remove district-months with noise) 
  - Using sum_pix * weights from ML model (and remove district-months with noise)
  - Using absolute value of weights across and take all data (and take all district month pairs)

Seems one of the ways of attaining near to HWS results is **by weeding out the months** with noise, which is identified through the coefficients from the ML model.  Note that this methods only filters out the month and does not remove countries (except for US Virgin Islands and Mauritius). At max only 5.7% district months are left out (max for US virgin islands 11%,  Brazil-7%, France-6%, Mozambique-6%)

## Developing variants: on India 

The variants follow three principles. The principles are

- (i) addressing the drop in light intensity by developing a non-decreasing series over time for each state (based on the understanding that the if lights represent economic activities, then no abrupt decrease should occur unless there is a shock), 
- (ii) studying selective regions (pixels) that are least likely to witness a drop in lights intensity
- (iii) addressing drop in light intensity by controlling for cloud cover (here, we make use of an ancillary series released along with the light intensity which contains information on number of days in a month the pixels were covered with clouds.
