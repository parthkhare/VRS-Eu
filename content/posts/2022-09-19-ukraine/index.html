<p>Each passing day of the Ukrainian invasion is taking a toll on not only the lives but the future livelihood of millions. With optimism on war nearing its end, its important to start taking a stock of the extent of loss in public infrastructure, natural-resources and worst hit regions. Doing so, will not only help in targeting focused reparative efforts but also save time in policy reforms till surveys and ground assessments are undertaken.</p>
<p>Satellite data is a useful resource in the absence of real time data. Imagery from daytime satellites have already proven to be useful learning of the initial <a href="https://www.space.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-satellite-photos">encroachment by Russian army</a>, and how Russia strategically targeted <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/satellites-ukraine-russia-grain/">Ukrainian grains</a>. Nightlights can help in assessing the extent of economic disruption from loss in electrification, demolition of houses, public infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Assessing impact of war in Ukarine from nightlights</h2>
<p>The following images show the drastic drop in nightlights across Ukraine from February to May 2022.</p>

<li>NOTE

<li>It should be remembered that lights are not exactly income. While they can be used and have proven to be a helpful proxy for estimating economic growth.</li>
<li>Nightlight measures radiance of light in Watt/cm2/sr, and all the maps here use the same legend for comparing results ovetime</li>
<li>Nightlights data for month of June seems to been biased by external noise from shells and not included here</li>
